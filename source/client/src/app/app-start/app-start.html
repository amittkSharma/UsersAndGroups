                    <p>
                      For the demo purposes some assumptions are being made:
                        <br>App is restricted to add new groups and new users (user joining groups on creation time).
                        <br>There are pre-defined group types are present in the system.
                        <br>The menu items are disablesd for demo purpose, they represent the future aspect of application.
                        <br>A user can only be created after selecting one of the existing groups.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Future Aspects:
                          <br> Sending mails for notification
                          <br>Displaying discussion section in groups page
                          <br>Ability to change membership status
